Friend Finder is an app meant to match people based on personality compatibility. The user answers a series of ten questions tailored to assess the fundamental aspects of their character. The app then returns the name of the person they are most compatible with. The user's information is also added to the database (for as long as the server is continuously running), making them possible matches for the next person to take the test.

Friend Finder was constructed using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Node.js, Express, AJAX, JSON, Bootstrap and a host of other helpful technologies. It can be accessed on both Github and Heroku (https://protected-basin-10675.herokuapp.com/).

This app may be improved in the future with the addition of more matches to the database, mainly through allowing user input to be saved from session to session.
